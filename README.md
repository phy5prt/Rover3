# Rover3

This project is an approach to the rover challenge utilising the command pattern and working to the premise 
of multiple rovers created and destroyed by the user sent to location using a text string with ordinates.
Rovers can move in multiple directions, turn in multiple direction and will have actions executable in locations.
