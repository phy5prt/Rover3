This is not exactly command pattern could i make it more like it

LookNorth could be just look if it took an orientation object, 
the type of object could be set in the dictionary but it would then have a different signature

still struggling with open close principle and setting the key presses

trying to make it so only need add class in one place to need it 

if want to do left and right could do an enum for the directions cycle through them and loop round
-maybe next rover
