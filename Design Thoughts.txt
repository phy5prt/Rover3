My understanding of Get Set and this needs revising look at the Location interface and constructor then research

Should build own dictionary still

This is not exactly command pattern could i make it more like it

LookNorth could be just look if it took an orientation object, 
the type of object could be set in the dictionary but it would then have a different signature

still struggling with open close principle and setting the key presses

trying to make it so only need add class in one place to need it 

if want to do left and right could do an enum for the directions cycle through them and loop round
-maybe next rover

multiple rovers - 1-2-3-4 to set up, check if they are going to crash- next phase


View user interface control the command model the rovers and the positions - could mvc be appplicable?

Commands should have their own key in their class that the dictionary takes, and a description so that the dictionary can get the classes 
and build itself and the keys, it should also be able to when user interface goes through the commands provide a description of what each does

should the rover force checking of valid command sequence in its method to stop later it being called without or because it is not the brain should it just rely on one always being called then the other
I think the answer will be to do with errors and validation

string builder look into

does dictionary adding the to it break open close principle
